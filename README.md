# Square-Puzzle-Mania

It is a GUI based Sliding Block Puzzle game which runs as a Desktop application.

It consists of a puzzle that has been divided in N x N tiles. One tile is taken out and the others are shuffled. 

The objective is to rearrange the puzzle into its correct original order by moving the tiles. 

The game has 4 difficulty levels to play in. 

The game keeps track of the total number of moves made and the total amount of time taken to complete the puzzle depending on which the score is calculated once the user has solved the puzzle. 

And at the end the score gets stored in the database, thus the score is made available even after the application is closed.
